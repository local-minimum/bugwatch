Game Off 2021 Entry

## Story

-- **SPOILERS** --

It's a postapocalypical world. The remnants of urbanization are visible, but vegetation is reclaiming most of what previously was in the human domain.
With the climate change having both wrecked society and upended the balance in nature, there are small pockets of humaity left and an abundance of small critters and crawlers.

The protagonist is an entomologist, with a true passion for BUGS!

At the outset the player sees the protagonist looking for bugs among the ruins and communicating with a third party about what they encounter.
As the game progresses it becomes more and more evident that something is off and the player is a bit too eager about the bugs.
Because in reality the player is parasitized and is infact trying to find a mate bringing the player as an offering of a nursery for the next generation of bugs.

## Bug interaction phases

1. **Spot**: Get some indication of bug, but not more (hear noise in a wall, see on inside but doesn't dare enter, that type of thing)
2. **Observe**: Get to see enough to make a sketch in `notebook`
3. **Collect**: Have something to lure/trap bug then put in `collection jar`

For **Collect** there's a need for `bait`.

## Baits

1. `Sweets`
2. `Rat` (dead?) If one attempts to interact with the spot where the rat should be placed before one has the rat the player may joke about using themself.
3. ...
4. `Self`

To be able to interact with some `baits` and open up other parts of the map there are tools to pick up.

## Tools

1. `Gloves` (perhaps a pair of yellow cleaning gloves), required to interact with nasty things like `trash bins` and `carcasses`.
2. `Helmet` (perhaps a kids bike helmet), required to dare enter building since they are unsafe and parts of the ceiling may fall down.
3. `Weapon` (perhaps a baseball bat), because some parts looks too dangerous (not really, but it's to feel safe).

Maybe something too that would allow balancing on a log / something that bridges a small ditch with a few centimeters of water in the bottom. Life preserver or similar is a bit too similar to `helmet` in function so perhaps rather something that allows creation of what will span the ditch.
