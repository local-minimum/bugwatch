Game Off 2021 Entry

## Story Idea 1

-- **SPOILERS** --

It's a postapocalypical world. The remnants of urbanization is visible, but vegitation is reclaiming most of what previously was in the human domain.
With the climate change having wrecked both society and upended the balance in nature, there are small pockets of humaity left and an abundance of small critters and crawlers.

The protagonist is an entomologist, with a true passion for BUGS!

At the outset the player sees the protagonist looking for bugs among the ruins and communicating with a third party about what they encounter.
As the game progresses it becomes more and more evident that something is off and the player is a bit too eager about the bugs.
Because in reality the player is parasitized and is infact trying to find a mate bringing the player as an offering of a nursery for the next generation of bugs.

But how does it end?
